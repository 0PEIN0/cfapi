Codeforces AngularJS Api Client

Codeforces api client built using AngularJS. The most important fact about this api-client is that you don't need a server to run this library. You can just run the index.html file and use it from there. And if you insist on running this on a server, that would work too.

Technologies used:
i) Bootstrap 3.3.4
ii) JQuery 2.1.3
ii) AngularJS 1.4.0-rc.1

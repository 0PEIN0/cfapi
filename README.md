## Codeforces AngularJS Api Client

Codeforces api client built using AngularJS. The most important fact about this api-client is that **you don't need a server** to run it. You can just run the **index.html** file and use it from there. And if you insist on running this on a server, that would work too. Currently the features are extremely limited, I'll add more as we go forward.

#### How to Run
* A preview on web can be found [here](http://0pein0.github.io/cfapi/).
* Or [Download](https://github.com/0PEIN0/cfapi/archive/master.zip) this repository and run **index.html** file on your favorite browser([chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/) usage recommended).

#### How to Change Default Handle
Open **Settings** page from navigation menu(you know, the one with gear sign) and update the default handle there.

#### Features Available
1. *Personal submission list.*
2. *Recent submissions on Codeforces.*
3. *Contest standings with country filter.*
4. *Contest submissions.*
5. *All table columns are sortable. Strings and numbers are identified automatically while sorting.*
6. *All tables have their own respective data filters.*

#### Api Documentations
* [Api Definition Help](http://codeforces.com/api/help)

2. *JQuery 2.1.3* (only for supporting bootstrap library)
3. *AngularJS 1.4.0-rc.2* (will use 1.4 upon final release, for now it's this release candidate)

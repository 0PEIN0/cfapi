## Codeforces AngularJS Api Client

Codeforces api client built using AngularJS. The most important fact about this api-client is that you don't need a server to run it. You can just run the index.html file and use it from there. And if you insist on running this on a server, that would work too. Currently the features are extremely limited, I'll add more as we go forward.

#### How to Run
Download this repository and run **index.html** file on your favorite browser([chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/) usage recommended).

#### How to Change Default Handle
Open '**js/conf-settings-structure.js**' file on a text editor and change the property value of '*this.defaultUserHandle*' to your intended handle.

#### Features Available
1. *Personal Submission List*
2. *Recent Submissions on Codeforces*
3. *Contest Standings with Country Filter*
4. *All Table Columns are Sortable.*

#### Technologies Used
